# NOTE THAT EACH YAML IS DIFFERENT, IT'S BEST TO START A NEW FILE AND GO FROM THEIR EXAMPLE.

# Rmarkdown cheatsheet -- top level header {#sec:intro}

## References and cross references -- 2nd level header

A bib reference [@matejka_same_2017]].

Given that you have taged a header with trailing `'  {#sec:intro}'`. A [Section intro](#sec:intro) reference, alternatively, section \@ref(sec:intro) (`\@ref(sec:intro)`).

A figure \@ref(fig:crest) reference (`\@ref(fig:crest)`).


__For bib files:__ make sure to include `bibliography: <MyFilename>.bib` in the YAML header and have asscociated .bib file in the base directory.

__For Tex Title pages:__ make sure to include them in the YAML header (see this one) and have the asscociated .sty files in the base directory.

__For figure references:__ make sure to use `bookdown::pdf_document2` (with 2) in the yaml, turns an R chunk name into a label, alternatively hardcode labels in the caption with `"\\label{fig:fig1} Some caption here"` while kniting to a `pdf_document`.

`\@ref(<label>)` is used with bookdown::pdf_document2, `\ref{<label>}` (no @, curly {}) is standard md.


## Figure height and width {#sec2:subsection}

`fig.height=2, fig.width=3` [inches] will effect R rendered plots.

while `out.height = "20%", out.width = "20%"` will effect both `include_graphics()` and R rendered plots.


```{r crest, echo=FALSE, out.height = "20%", out.width = "20%", fig.cap = "A caption for crest figure"}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/crest.jpg",)
```

## Intermediate MD formating

sub/superscript^2^~2~

~~strikethrough~~

escaped characters: \* \_ \\

endash: --, emdash: ---

in-line equation: $A = \pi*r^{2}$

equation block: $$E = mc^{2}$$
